# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I chose to incorporate the terminal table gem into my project in order to make the output of my program look better. 
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1...
	This was the integration of Terminal-Table Gem which made the output of my lists look better using more ASCII characters to make the list easier to read.

	I allowed the user to change the due date for a to-do item in their list. 

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent a long time working on this however that was partially because I was swamped with other work to complete. I struggled to understand how the modules and functions/commands would handle the various variables that were created in different files.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Being able to read through Gem files and implement the ruby gem into my own code. It illustrated that I was able to read through code and through instruction make my own code much more powerful
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I integrated the gem Terminal table in order to produce a prettier output in the command line. I also added the feature for the user to change the due date for an item in their todo list
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I still need to get better at writing code from scratch without looking for code references. I want to become more confident that I know how to set up a certain structure before seeking out code references that confirm how to implement a certain structure. I also need to get better and remembering where I left off with a piece of code. I know that this would be remedied with more commenting in my code along with pushing more updates to my Github rather than coding in one big swoop.
